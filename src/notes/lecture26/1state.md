# state

state refers to an object that holds data about the component.
state is managed within the component(just like variables declared in a function).
However, unlike regular variables, when state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect these changes, keeping the ui in sync with the data.

# state is dynamic and mutable

meaning it can change over time in response to user actions, server reponses or other event
