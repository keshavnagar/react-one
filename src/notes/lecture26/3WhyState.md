# why state

1. dynamic ui updates: state allows our components to update dynamically in response to user inpur or other events.
eg: in a form, the state might hold the current value of the input fields, updating in real time as the user types.

2. interactivity: state makes our app interactive. by maintaining state, we can create compnoents that respond to user actions, such as clicks, form submissions, or keyboard inputs.

3. data management: state helps manage data within a component. eg:  we cant fetch data from an api and store it in the state, which will then be used to render the ui.

4. component communication: state can lifted up to parent componentns to manage state across multiple child components , ensuring consistent data flow and syncronization.
