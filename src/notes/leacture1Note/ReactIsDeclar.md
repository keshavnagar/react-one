so in screenshot [reactisdeclar](reactIsDeclar.png) file why ? 
so the answer in [reactIsDeclar2](reactIsDeclar2.png)
like it is abstract, and the focus is more on how we visualize our ui , it is not like how it is worked behind or not , so our focus on only render the ui component
so we have another image that name is [reactIsDeclar3](reactIsDeclar3.png) where we say to react in a component show the name here we do not use dom manipulation so we are just depend on our react , react is handle themselve
so the image show the declarative aproach
here we have another image [reactIsDeclar4.png](reactIsDeclar4.png) is show to us the imparative aproach of react
where we create a div element 
and we pass our name variable inside them with the help of textcontent property and return that element
here is diffrence like we order some thing to chef and chef already know about my test and make dishesh like we just go to shop and buy poha 
but in imparative way we buy kaccha poha and than so many things to cook the poha and than we eat
