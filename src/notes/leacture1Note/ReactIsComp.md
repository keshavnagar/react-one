like we see in the image [ReactIsComp](./ReactIsComp.png), so react follow component based architecture in which we do not required repeat one thing again and again we just make the one compoenent if again it is required we use that again with their name only eg navbar, links in navbar, cards and so on in website![alt text](image.png)
Benefit of componet in react js is suppose we have diffrent cards that show the details about countries and the properties are same like name, population and capital, and one image but the values are different so if we are in our html and css we need to create saparately but the component architecuture we just use one card as one component and change their data according to the requirement so it is very helpful , clean , reusable and less storage thing
