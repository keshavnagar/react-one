why react over js? 
so in old system we have system in which we have saparate things like
index.htm
style.css
script.js
so different files 
but here in react we mix the things but we also saparate with the help of component 
like in those saparate file system we create button again and again and use them in diffrent places but in react we just create a component and use them with just their name only not dfine whole button in everywhere
like the benefit is like if we want to change in any things like in button we just change the button component and it applies everywhere
but in those saparate files system we just copy paste code and also we are going everywhere for only one change or more changes
it is also visualize in [WhyReact.png](WhyReact.png) and [WhyReact2.png](WhyReact2.png)

for sequence I add the ppd in notes so it is give you a sequnce of notes so do not worry about that thing
