how react works: 
first we create component 
if we use that same component again and again it is called instances
now the browser compile these instances and our browser do not understand the react it understand only js so it convert the whole code in html , css and js
like browser conver our instances into react element and these react elements are called virtual dom and the react elements create a dom elements and it is that dom element that we create by our own in imparative aproach in image [reactIsDeclar4.png](reactIsDeclar4.png)
and this dom elements finally seen in our webpage 
it is like an abstraction between core js and react and it is like declarative face
