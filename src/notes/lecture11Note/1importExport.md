import export in react js
1. default export and import
2. named export and import
3. mixed export and import 

so first thing for this we make a folder components and shift netflix card into this 

now ont things is important here that mention in below: 

1. default export: a file can have only one default export.
and than we  import in out app component
so let we do

2. in app component we write import NetflixCard from ...
so we also add another name instead of this like NCard or NetCard and so on....

2. the second thing is like, we also have another type of import and export 

and that is 

NAMED import and export

like that think we do with our [netflix card component ](../../components/NetflixCard.jsx)

so the change is we add export in before the component name in component file and add the component name in import section of app component in our {}
