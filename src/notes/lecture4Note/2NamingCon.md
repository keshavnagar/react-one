in naming convention we learn about naming like 
here we see in our App.css here A is capital 
also in App.jsx A is again capital
but index.css i is small
and in main.jsx it is also small
so confusion is where we use the right naming convention about our project files
so first we learn about how many types of cases
1. camelCase: used for variables, function, properties in object, file name, etc
capitalization of each word except the first is done
2. PascalCase: used for component name, class name, types, etc
capitalization of each word is done
3. snake_case: it is not common in js but is used heavily in python
each word is separated by "_" and is in small letters
4. kebab-case: it is common for file name , css classess, ids, etc.
each word is separated by hyphen(-)
