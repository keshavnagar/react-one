so in this image we have project str 
it is also in our project str also like in left side where we see simply and really

2. public folder contains image file and video and fonts
3. src contains all source files react components, js files, and css 
4. app..jsx is main react component that acts
5. main.jsx is entry point that is contain the app.jsx inside them to create an element like in js and pass to main index.html file

its work is like we are writing any code in our react js that should be perfect and correct by this file, like it give an error 
7. git ignore file , like if you want to do not add your file or folder in git , show you just add those into this file and those are not added into git command or git tool like we have nodemodules that we do not share on our github so it is defaultly add into github ignore file like you see this one, like we also use this one for security like if we do not upload our file into github we just take that and put inside this file like other things like password and protected keys we do not want to upload in our repo so we are store them into this gitignore file
8. html file: the main html file where our react app is loaded serving as the entry point for the web browser
9. package.json: this file contains all the details or configuratoins regarding this project, it includes name, version, description, scripts, like in this there are if you install some liberaries in your project for eg router or icons and any things that you install in your react project that things mentino in this package.json file like we use react vite so it shows the details about vite and in dependencies we see the react and react dom react js is just a liberary for creating dynamic user interface, react dom is used to render those components on our web page, we might have heard about react native for creating mobile app, which is also based on react js but there is not react dom concept 
10. vite config js: this file contains config to vite
