            this is first note

so in our react project we have a html file [index](../../../index.html) 
so in that html file we have same html file but we create a div that id is root that contains all our single page of react and we also link this file to main.jsx in script tag its like a js file who manipulate the changes that we want
now we have main.jsx file that is : [main.jsx](../../main.jsx)
so this main.jsx file is contain that root id from html index like js we also use getelement by ide and we render the whole app component inside this root div with the help of render function

like we create a root -> root div of html file -> app 
and we render the whole app component inside them
