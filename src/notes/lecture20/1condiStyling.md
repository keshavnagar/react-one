so in town awareness project i used conditional styling in my way: 
in which I give the class name two different and manage them with condtinon like if the conditno is true than the fierst class is aapear otherwise second class

# css conditional stylings in react js

we can use ternary operators to add conditional stylings to our css

we also put logical operators also here 

but one thing in our code again that is also we discuss in previous chapater that is we apply this inline even it is classname not inline but also it renders again and again and not look good here

so we declare that thing in above in our component like we do in our previous videos

so here we do the rendering on top of the component return section , because we  know the condtions that return also store in any variable and store them in another new variable
