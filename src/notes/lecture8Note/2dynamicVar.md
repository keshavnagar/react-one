here we learn dynamic values using variables
so we can embed any js variable within jsx by enclosing it in {}.
the value of the variable will be inserted into the dom at the respective location
so in our app component we are changing the value that we written by directly we store in variable and showo them with {} to dynamically
go app component and change them with dynamic value [app component](../../App.jsx)
so i setup the all the things in my repo and clear the flow like every thing i just learn put in that branch 
so i again do one more thing like 
we also put our image url into dynamic variable in our app's netflix card component
