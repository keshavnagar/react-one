i creating repo because i want to track all the thing that i creating 
readme.md already bani huyi hai so we do not need to recreate that 
than we run the command git init
and than why they said git add readme.md not git add .  
so first we add readme and after i add  . all 
than i also commit before i added the dynamic value in variable by using {}
and also check the default branch master by git branch
we have also command git branch --show-current
so it is also show master
first i created the main branch named main
and than connected to github 
and then i push the code in main branch 
but now i want to take an initiative to create different branches to learning how to create branches and use them into our projects and i use with my this text file for simple for my mind
so create a  new branch with the help of git checkout -b dynamicVar
here i also push my code okay so this is the change that i write here is save in this branch so i am curious about this experiment
like now save my changes in this branch 
by git add. 
git commit........
and than i also git push -u origin dynamicVar
like i successfully done the creating new branch and add and commit things inside them and also remove my fear from this side 
now i again commit something inside them to send my successfull message to the github
so i also learn about how i merge branch and all the added and commits of my dynamicVar branch is show in our main branch now 
so for merge i use first git switch main to switch into main branch and than git merge dynamicVar it ensure we merge both branch and all the things inside the new branches shift into my main branch and also i push these things into github so it also show online
