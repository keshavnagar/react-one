i creating repo because i want to track all the thing that i creating 
readme.md already bani huyi hai so we do not need to recreate that 
than we run the command git init
and than why they said git add readme.md not git add .  
so first we add readme and after i add  . all 
than i also commit before i added the dynamic value in variable by using {}
and also check the default branch master by git branch
we have also command git branch --show-current
so it is also show master
first i created the main branch named main
and than connected to github 
and then i push the code in main branch 
but now i want to take an initiative to create different branches to learning how to create branches and use them into our projects and i use with my this text file for simple for my mind
so create a  new branch with the help of git checkout -b dynamicVar
here i also push my code okay so this is the change that i write here is save in this branch so i am curious about this experiment
like now save my changes in this branch 
by git add. 
git commit........
