now we learn about dynamic value using expression: 

this is second thing like first thing we learn about how we use the dynamic value in jsx using {} and put the value inside them 

and now we learn about how we also add the expressoin like 1+2 in our jsx syntax using {}

like in first we use variable that is dynamicalliy change like in first we just change them and only we use tha varible name 

but now we also use expression in our {}

so i write the formal definitino of this things : 

jsx allows us to write js expression inside {}. this includes opearations, function calls, and other js expression that produce a value.

like in our app component we just add opeartion in rating okay we just remove that dynamic variable and use the addition operaiotn there go to [app](../../App.jsx)
