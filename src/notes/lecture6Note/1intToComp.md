In react, a component is essentially a js function or class that returns jsx, a syntax extenstion that allows us to write html like code in js.
components are the building blocks of any react application, allowing for the creation of complex and interactive user interface through the assembly of isolated, reusable pieces.
we can also use .js extension with react js components but it's recommended to use .jsx to differentiate between regular js and react js components.
there two ways to create components in react js
1. class based components
this is how components were created bfore functional components 
we use function components in now days so ignore this one
2. functional components
this is modern and recommended way of writing react js components
we will follow through functional components in this course as that's what is used
if we find class based components in legacy codebases, we can search online there some differences, but main concept is same
