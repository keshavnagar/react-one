now i put shadow in my cards 
and with the help of box shadow
and thing is i also put more than one shadow in my one card 
so we are not trying to do that but we just know about it
we use shadow in two dimentions like vertical offset and horizontal offset 
like i give in grid item class situated in my sereiscard.jsx and seriescard.css 
so basically the shadow's two dimensions here is it push from upper to lower by 10 px and left to right 10 px as we seen in both w3 website and our card shadow in our seriescard.jsx and seriescard.css
