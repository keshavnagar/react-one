now we do the practical part in which i play with files okay
like we use the rule number three in which we just import the styles as an object from modules.css file and than we use the class name as an propertye of that style object of our component
and we also add the class name in our curly braces because we know the object property is like an object property so this is js part and the js part is always come in {}
